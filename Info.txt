A compound is a lexeme (less precisely, a word) that consists of more than one stem.
Compounding or composition is the word formation that creates compound lexemes.
Word-compounding refers to the faculty and device of language to form new words 
by combining or putting together old words. 
In other words, compound, compounding or word-compounding occurs when a person 
attaches two or more words together to make them one word.
